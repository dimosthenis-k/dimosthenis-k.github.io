My CV as a website experiment. I used mainly vanilla stuff, since at this time, using a framework would just add complexity. I plan on making a more refined version using Angular in the near future, look out for it! :telescope:

I tried to give it a halloween aesthetic, since it is just around the corner at the time i'm building it. :ghost:

Feel free to use it as a template.
